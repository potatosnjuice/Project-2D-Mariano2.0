Scientific Question: Using differential gene expression analysis comparing gene expression of wild type mice under a calorie restriction versus the gene expression of SIRT3 knockout mice under a calorie restriction, what are the major differences in gene expression between the two samples and how can that reveal the nature of SIRT3 protein? Hypothesis: If there are genes found in the calorie restricted SIRT3 knockout mice that are downregulated compared to similar genes found in the calorie restricted wildtype mice, then the genes that have been downregulated have functions stronly related to the function and role of SIRT3.
